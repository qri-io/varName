This is the first proper release of `varName`. In preparation for go 1.13, in which `go.mod` files and go modules are the primary way to handle go dependencies, we are going to do an official release of all our modules. This will be version v0.1.0 of `varName`.

### Bug Fixes

* updated and added back test coverage script ([7bf6c06](https://github.com/qri-io/varName/commit/7bf6c06))
* updated function `MakeNameUnique` to pass additional tests ensuring correct enumeration ([f248bd4](https://github.com/qri-io/varName/commit/f248bd4))
* Updated truncateList() to work correctly for all 3 cases (Left, Right, Edge) ([8a89eee](https://github.com/qri-io/varName/commit/8a89eee))


### Features

* added snake and kebab case options and set default to snake ([96f6263](https://github.com/qri-io/varName/commit/96f6263))
* initial commit ([9c25cdf](https://github.com/qri-io/varName/commit/9c25cdf))
